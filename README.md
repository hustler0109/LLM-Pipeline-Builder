# VectorShift – LLM Pipeline Builder 

🔗 **Live Demo:** https://vector-shift-asgt.vercel.app/

VectorShift is a **visual pipeline builder** for constructing and validating **LLM-based workflows** using a node-based interface. Users can connect different pipeline components into a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** and validate the structure before execution.

The project focuses on **clear data flow, correctness, and explainability**, rather than hidden abstractions.

## 🚀 Features

- Node-based visual pipeline editor  
- Explicit **Input → Text → LLM → Output** flow  
- DAG validation (cycle detection)  
- Pipeline analysis on submission  
- Clean and minimal UI for clarity

**Explanation**
- The **UI** allows users to visually construct pipelines
- **Graph State** maintains nodes and edges
- **DAG Validator** ensures the pipeline is acyclic
- **Analysis Output** summarizes pipeline validity

### Node Responsibilities
- **Input Node** – Entry point for data
- **Text Node** – Prompt or instruction formatting
- **LLM Node** – Represents model processing
- **Output Node** – Captures final result
